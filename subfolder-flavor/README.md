Here are the toolchain to create the 'subfolder flavor' of PEXAdmin

This 'subfolder flavor' must be used if you cannot set a specific virtualhost to the public folder
or you want PEXAdmin in a subfolder of your website

Run the .bat file in Windows or the .sh file under GNU/Linux

Then copy the created folder to the location where you want to run PEXAdmin
